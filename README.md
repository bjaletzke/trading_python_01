# Trading Metals 
There must be a large amount of repositories on GitHub that began as projects which feel super challenging to teh person creating it, but to an actual programmer would appear almost comically simple (and full of errors). But we must all make a start somewhere. 
I created, with the help of my group at LBS, a very simple and bad [trading strategy](https://github.com/bjaletzke/metals_tma). During the creation of that document, I kept getting really, really frustrated with how R works. 

Yes, I know, I don't get to be frustrated with it, because I've been using it for all of a month, but when it's 3am and simple for loops keep just not working, it gets to you, ok? So I decided that once the project was submitted, I would take some time to remake the base code, and improve on it, using pyhton. THe main point is to (re-)learn Python, and this seems like a somewhat suitable project for it.
